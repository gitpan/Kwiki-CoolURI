NAME
       Kwiki::CoolURI - makes the Kwiki url cleaner

SYNOPSIS
        $ cd /path/to/kwiki
        $ kwiki -add Kwiki::CoolURI

DESCRIPTION
       Changes the internal links that Kwiki create. Instead of
       /index.cgi?SandBox, it will just be /SandBox.

       It only changes the url for the display plugin. Edit will still look
       like /index.cgi?action=edit&page_name=SandBox.

       Configuration

       Kwiki needs to be able to read request on the form /SandBox. With
       Apache this can be solved by putting the following mod_rewrite config
       in a .htaccess file in the directory where index.cgi is located.

        RewriteEngine  on
        RewriteCond    $1 !(css/|icons/|index.cgi|local/|palm90.png|plugin/|theme/)
        RewriteRule    ^(.*)$ index.cgi?action=display&page_name=$1 [L]

       If you add new top directories, or files, that you still want to be
       readable, you have to add them in the RewriteCond.

BUGS
       Does not currently fix the redirect that for instance happens after an
       edit.

       Should use new Kwiki 0.37 hooks.

       The mod_rewrite config could probably be better.

       The code is just copied from the original methods and slightly changed
       to output different urls. If Kwiki had a way to configure what the link
       urls should look like, this plugin wouldn't be needed.
